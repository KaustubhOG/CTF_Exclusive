## Insp3ct0r — quick writeup

**What it was:** A small DOM/JS puzzle where useful info was hidden in client-side code or devtools-only assets. The page looked empty but the devtools revealed the flag.

**How I found it:** Opened devtools (Elements/Network/Source). Found a commented-out string, an inline script setting a variable, or a JSON file fetched that contained the flag.

**Exploit (short):**

1. Open the page and press F12.
2. Check `Elements` for HTML comments, `Sources` for JS files, and `Network` for XHR/JSON responses.
3. Look for suspicious strings, base64 blobs, or variables like `const flag = "..."` and copy the value.

**Fix:** Don’t store secrets in client-side code or comments. Anything sent to the browser is public.
