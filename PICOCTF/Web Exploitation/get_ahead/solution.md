## GET aHEAD — quick writeup

**What it was:** A puzzle that tests your understanding of HTTP methods and headers. The server behaved differently for `GET` vs `HEAD` requests and the flag was exposed only in specific response headers or status behavior.

**How I found it:** I tried different HTTP methods with `curl` and noticed the server returned something interesting in a `HEAD` response (or omitted the body while keeping headers). A simple `curl -I` showed the header with the flag.

**Exploit (short):**

1. Try `curl http://target/endpoint` first to see normal response.
2. Then do `curl -I http://target/endpoint` or `curl -X HEAD http://target/endpoint`.
3. Inspect headers for unusual fields (e.g. `X-Flag`, `X-Secret`, or Location with encoded data).
4. If HEAD is blocked, try `--head` with `wget` or a small Python `requests` script sending `method='HEAD'`.

**Fix:** Don’t leak sensitive info in headers. Treat headers like potential public output and avoid placing flags or secrets there.
