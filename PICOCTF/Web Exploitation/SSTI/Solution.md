SSTI — quick writeup

What it was: A template rendered user input without escaping, so template expressions were evaluated.

How I found it: I sent {{7*7}} to the page and got 49 back — that confirmed server-side evaluation.

Exploit (short):

Confirm with {{7*7}}.

Enumerate objects to find a way to run commands (Jinja-like engines: ().__class__ trick).

Use a subprocess-based payload (adjust indexes) to run cat /flag or id and read the flag.

Fix: Don’t render raw user templates. Escape user input or use a sandboxed renderer.
