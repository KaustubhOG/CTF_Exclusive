## Cookies — quick writeup

**What it was:** A web page relied on a cookie value for authentication/logic and didn’t protect or validate it properly.

**How I found it:** I inspected the cookies in the browser devtools, saw a suspicious cookie (e.g. `auth` or `session`) and tried simple tweaks: changing values, tampering with JSON-like contents, and replaying after edits.

**Exploit (short):**

1. Open devtools → Application → Cookies.
2. Export or copy the cookie value and edit it (e.g. change `role=user` → `role=admin`, or flip a `true`/`false`).
3. Re-insert the modified cookie and refresh the page. If the server trusts the cookie without verification, you get elevated access or the flag.

**Variants:**

* If the cookie is unsigned but JSON-like, you can directly edit fields.
* If it’s base64-encoded, decode, edit, re-encode, and paste back.
* If it’s a JWT with a weak secret, try `alg=none` or brute-force the secret.

**Fix:** Server-side validation only. Don’t store trustable data client-side without integrity checks (use signed cookies or server-side sessions)
