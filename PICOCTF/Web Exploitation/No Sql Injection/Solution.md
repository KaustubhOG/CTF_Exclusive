## No SQL Injection — quick writeup

**What it was:** A classic SQL injection lab that allows injecting payloads into a query to leak data — here it was intentionally easy and blind-vulnerable.

**How I found it:** I submitted `' OR '1'='1` into an input (login/search) and saw the application behave differently — either bypassing auth or returning more rows.

**Exploit (short):**

1. Test for injection: submit `' OR '1'='1` or `" OR "1"="1` in form fields.
2. If response is different, try extracting data with simple payloads:

   * `' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users -- `
   * For blind boolean: `' AND (SELECT SUBSTRING(password,1,1) FROM users WHERE username='admin')='a' -- ` and iterate.
3. Use error-based or union-based techniques depending on the DB error messages and returned columns.

**Fix:** Use parameterized queries / prepared statements. Never concatenate user input into SQL.
