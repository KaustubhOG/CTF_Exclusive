## How I use this repo
1. Solve a challenge on a platform (e.g., picoCTF).  
2. Add a short writeup file under the appropriate folder:  
   - Filename suggestion: `YYYY-MM-DD-challenge-name.md` or `challenge-name.md`.  
   - Keep it concise: problem summary, key steps, final command/script, and flag (optional).  
3. Put any scripts in a `scripts/` subfolder inside the challenge folder.  
4. Commit & push with a clear message, e.g.:

git add .
git commit -m "solved(picoCTF): web-exploitation - <challenge-name>"
git push origin main
